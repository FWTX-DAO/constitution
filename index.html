    <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
    <p>[Brief overview of the Fort Worth City DAO initiative, its goals, and key features]</p>
    <p>Fort Worth DAO is a municipal, non-profit, research, and education focused DAO dedicated to the promotion and integration of Web3 technologies into everyday civic life. By fostering education and collaboration, we aim to create a more informed and equitable digital future.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to establish Fort Worth as a leading Web3 city, leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized governance to enhance security, efficiency, and citizen participation in the information age.</p>
    <p>We aim to resolve workforce development, accelerate cyber-ready workforce and student development, accessible workshops, and strategic forsight on Fort Worth and the Web3 skills to protect, serve, and innovate our community in the face of hyper-entangled institutional challenges through non-traditional means.</p>
    <h2>2. Introduction</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Vision and Mission</h3>
    <p><strong>Vision:</strong> To transform Fort Worth into a leading cyber-resilient city, leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized governance to enhance security, efficiency, and citizen participation in the information age.</p>
    <p><strong>Mission:</strong> To implement a robust City DAO framework that ensures cyber resilience, promotes transparent governance, and empowers citizens through secure digital participation.</p>

    <h3>2.2 The Need for Cyber-Resilient Cities</h3>
    <p>We are at a junction in human history where we have multi-matrixed challenges for constituents to manage the information at the sovereign individual, family, organization, and community level.</p> 
    <p>These challenges require us to think group up about the very basis of society and how we govern our regions. The information fabric of society is the basis of arguably every operation across industries, governments, and sectors. Augmenting the information architecture, inter-agency, multi-matrixed, and secure information sharing is imperative for the public and private to standardize with diligent cybersecurity principles to protect us from adversarial threats in cyber space. Web3 serves as an acronym that converges the evolution of the internet with its respective innovation to increase quality of life, productivity, and efficiency with software and data anchored leadership, boardrooms, and governance.</p>

    <h2>3. Overarching Constitution</h2>
    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <p>We are a City DAO dedicated to the promotion and integration of Web3 technologies into everyday civic life, with a focus on cyber resilience. By fostering education and collaboration, we aim to create a more informed, secure, and equitable digital future. We are a grassroots organization bound to Fort Worth Texas and dedicated to improving the Fort Worth community through Web3 and advanced cybersecurity practices.</p>

    <h3>Article 1: Name and Purpose</h3>
    <p>The name of the DAO is the "Fort Worth DAO," henceforth referred to as "FWTX DAO."</p>
    <p>The DAO's primary purpose is to progress urban development and citizen engagement in Fort Worth, Texas, harnessing the potential of Web3 technologies while ensuring robust cyber resilience. We aim to establish Fort Worth as a leading Web3 city with state-of-the-art digital security measures.</p>

    <h3>Article 2: Membership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Membership in the FWTX DAO is open to individuals passionate about our mission and committed to contributing to the DAO's objectives as described in this document.</li>
        <li>Members are expected to uphold the DAO's constitution, respect its values, and conduct themselves professionally and ethically. Membership of an individual can be terminated by a majority vote.</li>
        <li>Each member enjoys equal voting rights. One member equals one vote.</li>
        <li>Members are required to maintain high standards of cybersecurity hygiene and contribute to the overall digital resilience of the DAO.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 3: Leadership and Governance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The FWTX DAO will substantially follow the essence of the parliamentary rules of Robert's Rules of Order.</li>
        <li>Through the end of 2024, the two (2) Founders will be the Chair. After 2024 ends, the membership will optionally be able to submit names to fill the role of the Chair.</li>
        <li>The Chair of the FWTX DAO may be one or more members of the DAO, but not to exceed three members.</li>
        <li>For a proposal to be recognized before it can be seconded by a member and presented for discussion and a vote, the proposal must be recognized by the Chair. This recognition is to occur offchain in real life (IRL) and documented electronically for record before the proposal is submitted onchain.</li>
        <li>Voting will be defined as follows - A quorum (Minimum Participation) is 33% of the membership. A majority (Approval Threshold) is defined as 51% of the quorum. If the quorum is not met in the allotted time, the proposal will not pass.</li>
        <li>The DAO shall elect, through a proposal, a leadership team consisting of five (5) members who will oversee day-to-day operations. The leadership team shall include roles such as Director, Coordinator, Operations Manager, Community Manager, and Treasurer.</li>
        <li>The leadership team will also include a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) responsible for overseeing the DAO's cybersecurity initiatives and ensuring the implementation of best practices in digital resilience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 4: Financial Management</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The DAO shall maintain a digital treasury wallet to manage its financial resources securely.</li>
        <li>All financial decisions and significant financial transfers shall be approved by a majority vote of the members. The leadership team has the authority to approve smaller day-to-day expenses.</li>
        <li>Members may suggest budgets and financial initiatives to the leadership team, which will evaluate them based on their alignment with the DAO's purpose and available resources.</li>
        <li>An annual third-party audit shall be conducted to ensure the DAO's financial transparency and accountability.</li>
        <li>The DAO will implement advanced cryptographic security measures to protect its digital assets and financial transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 5: Dispute Resolution and Grievances</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Any disputes or grievances within the DAO shall first attempt to be resolved informally through dialogue and mediation.</li>
        <li>If informal methods fail, the parties involved may agree to resolve the matter externally through arbitration or legal recourse.</li>
        <li>In cases of cybersecurity breaches or digital disputes, a specialized cybersecurity arbitration process will be established to address these unique challenges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Article 6: Amendments, Dissolution, and Progress</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>This constitution may be amended by a majority vote of the members, ensuring a thorough review and discussion process.</li>
        <li>The DAO may be dissolved only by a unanimous vote of the total members. This will require an external voting process outside the normal process used for the governance of the DAO as described in this Constitution.</li>
        <li>The DAO's progress is measured against the roadmap as found on the FWTX DAO official GitHub repository, with milestones celebrated and strategies adjusted, as needed to support the success of the DAO.</li>

    </ul>
